# Goodread_books_DM

We have leveraged a Kaggle dataset that encompasses 11 features of high-quality books, boasting an impressive collection of nearly 11,000 unique titles. Our initial focus lies on visualizing and preparing the data, encompassing crucial steps such as outlier removal and standardization. Next, we train a model employing diverse clustering algorithms, including K-means, Agglomerative, Birch, and Gaussian Mixture. This model serves as the foundation for our innovative book suggestion engine, designed to provide users with personalized recommendations based on their input book, considering books within the same cluster or those that closely align with it.
